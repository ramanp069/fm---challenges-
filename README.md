**Intro section with dropdown navigation**
This challenge will test your ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites. 
It will also provide some nice basic layout challenges.

Name of the Challenge 
**Conference ticket generator**
In this challenge, I'll create a form that generates a ticket.
There's a lot of scope for customizing the generated ticket and putting your own stamp on the project.
